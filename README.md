# CS-GO-CONFIG
This is my custom settings i use for Counter Strike : Global Offensive, i dont really care about other people i made this personaly because i play
more than one set-up and it can be annoying to play with seperate configs, so i made this along with some batch files that auto upload my config
and auto download my config onto my other set-up any questions feel free to join my discord server: https://discord.gg/TyM8AkG
